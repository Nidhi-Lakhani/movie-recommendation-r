# movie-recommendation-r

The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. There are two types of recommendation systems â€“ Content-Based Recommendation System and Collaborative Filtering Recommendation. In this project of recommendation system in R, I have used a collaborative filtering recommendation system and more specifically, ITEM based collaborative recommendation system.

In order to build our recommendation system, I have used the MovieLens Dataset. I have used four R packages - recommenderlab, ggplot2, data.table and reshape2. This project contains 6 main tasks - 

1. Importing required data and packages
2. Exploring the data 
3. Data preprocessing
4. Data preparation - Selecting useful data, Normalizing data and Binarizing the data
5. Using the Collaborative Filtering System
6. Building the recommendation system

There are also various bar graphs and heatmaps using ggplot2 for better data visualization.
